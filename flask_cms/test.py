fight complications from cancer
Complications from cancer therapies can contribute to reduced protein intake --
which can lead to weakness and loss of energy.

To replace or rebuild -- muscle mass, white cells, red cells --
you need enough protein. During treatments, appetite can be weak,
and protein foods such as meat and eggs can have less appeal.

MAKE US PART OF YOUR SUCCESS STORY

Whey protein and Diabetes are a good combination but please consult your medical
practitioner before undergoing any changes to your diet just to be safe and whey
protein powder, nor any other supplement, should replace any medication you are prescribed.
